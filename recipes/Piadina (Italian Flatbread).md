# Piadina (Italian Flatbread)
## By: Melissa Johnson

* See the recipe Notes for sourdough starter information
* Ingredients
* 400g
* all purpose flour
* or
* whole grain emmer flour
* (3 cups)
* 200g
* sourdough starter
* (2/3 cup)
* 130-160g milk or water (heaping 1/2 cup to 2/3 cup)
* 80g olive oil or 100g lard (1/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup lard)
* 8-9g salt (1 1/2 tsp), drop this by half if you use baking soda
* optional 1 tsp baking soda (4g)
* Bakers Percentages
* 100% flour
* 46-52% water or milk
* 16% oil or 20% lard
* 2% salt (1% if you use baking soda)
* optional 0.8% baking soda

1. Combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. The baking soda is optional; remember to use half the salt if used.
2. Knead the dough on your work surface for a few minutes. Add water and flour as needed for a hand-kneadable hydration.
3. Cover the dough and let it rest anywhere from 30 minutes to several days in the refrigerator depending on the degree of fermentation desired.
4. Divide the dough in six pieces and form each piece into a ball. Cover and let rest about 15 minutes.
5. Begin heating a cast iron pan (10-12 inches diameter) on the stove on medium heat.
6. Using a rolling pin, roll out a dough ball into a circle 9-10 inches in diameter and 1/8-to-1/4 inch thick. If you want a uniform circle, you can use a bowl as a dough cutter.
7. Set the round of dough on the hot pan and dock it with a fork to prevent bubbles from forming. Cook each side for 1-2 minutes until it has medium brown spots.
8. I like to roll out each ball while the previous one is cooking, but you can pre-roll the six piadina if you prefer. You'll want to wait to heat up the pan until you're almost finished rolling if you prep all six piadina.
9. Lay a tea towel on a plate and stack the warm piadinas on it. Wrap the towel around the flatbreads to keep them warm and soft.
10. Serve wrapped around a variety of fillings: proscuitto, cheese, and arugula; a scrambled egg sandwich, or as a dessert with nutella and fruit. The piadinas and fillings can be re-grilled on the stovetop if desired.
