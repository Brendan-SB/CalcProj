# Sweet Tamales with Figs and Red Corn Masa
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 300g unsalted butter, lard, vegetable shortening, oil (I use 1 cup lard + 7 Tbsp butter)
* 175g sugar (3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp)
* 1 1/4 tsp baking powder (5.5g)
* 1/2 tsp salt (2.5g)
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (4g)
* 1/4 tsp ground all spice (0.5g)
* 1/8 tsp ground cardamom (0.25g)
* 500g
* red corn masa flour (harina)
* + 750g water (3 3/4 cups flour + 3 cups and 3 Tbsp water)
* OR
* 1.25 kg
* nixtamalized corn
* masa. This is 500g dried corn plus water that is absorbed during nixtamalization and added while grinding.
* Fig Filling
* 1/2 cup fig jam (4oz, 113g)
* 3/4 cup finely chopped dried figs (100g)
* Raspberries and Dark Chocolate Filling
* 250g dark chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups)
* 250g frozen raspberries (2 1/3 cups)

1. Rinse about 30 dried corn husks and then soak them overnight. Weigh them down with a plate so they stay submerged.
2. The next day, in the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment, beat the lard and butter until the mixture looks similar to merengue.
3. Slowly add the sugar, baking powder, salt, ground spices, and fig jam (skip the fig jam if you're making the raspberry and chocolate variation). Continue mixing and occasionally pause to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula.
4. Add the masa harina and water in parts, pausing the mixer so the dry flour doesn't poof out of the bowl. If you're using wet nixtamal masa, add it in chunks. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, check on the texture of the masa, and add more water if needed.
5. Run the mixer for about 3 additional minutes after you're satisfied with the masa's hydration. Then add the dried figs (or raspberries and chocolate chips) and mix briefly to distribute them throughout the batter.
6. Drain the water from the corn husks and pat them dry. Separate out small or damaged husks to use for lining your pot or tearing into strips to tie around the tamales.
7. Set up a tamale-making work area with the corn husks, a baking sheet for the finished tamales, a cutting board where you will fill and fold the tamales, and the bowl of masa with a spatula for scooping.
8. See the gallery below and video above for visual depiction of these instructions.
9. Place a corn husk on your cutting board with the narrow end/angle of the triangle closest to you. Scoop about 1/3 cup of filling and place it in the center of the husk. Fold the husk in half lengthwise, and then fold that empty double layer of husk over the filled portion of the tamale. Finally fold the pointy empty base of the tamale upward over the filled portion. Lay the folded tamale, final fold side down, on a baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling is gone.
10. Tear a couple of corn husks into strips and tie them around the tamales, over the final fold if possible.
11. Place a coin (e.g. nickel) on the bottom of your pot so the sound of it rattling will let you know your water is boiling. If the heat is high and the coin has gone silent, you need to add more water.
12. Add the steaming basket/rack and water, making sure the water is below the level of the basket. Then line the side of the pot with some of the extra husks to prevent the tamales from being flush with the hot sides of the pot.
13. Now add a loosely balled piece of aluminum foil to the pot to take up extra space (unless you've doubled the recipe or are using a small pot). Finally place your tamales in the pot with the final fold facing inward toward the foil ball. I put the larger tamales on the outside and the smaller ones in the middle.
14. Cover the tamales with more of the corn husks, tucking the narrow ends under the tops of the tamales. Add a small towel to the top of the husks and cover the pot with the lid.
15. Place the pot on the stove at high heat. When the water begins to boil (coin rattles), lower the heat until you feel pressure under the lid but the water is lightly boiling.
16. Set a timer for 1 hour and let the tamales continue to steam.
17. When the time is up, remove and unwrap one of the tamales. If the masa doesn't stick to the husk, it's done cooking. If the masa sticks to the husk, rewrap the tamale, add a little water to the pot, and steam for another 15-20 minutes before you check again.
18. Serve the tamales immediately or reheat them later in the microwave or on a fry pan. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator for about a week or wrap individually and freeze for several months.
