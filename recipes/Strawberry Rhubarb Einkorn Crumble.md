1. Melt the butter in the microwave on low power.
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar(s), baking powder, salt, and lemon zest.
3. Combine the dry and wet ingredients, including the optional sourdough starter.
4. Refrigerate while you prep the fruit.
5. Wash and slice the rhubarb and strawberries.
6. In a different bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch or tapioca flour, and lemon juice.
7. Pour the liquid over the fruit and mix thoroughly
8. Preheat your oven to 375F and lightly oil a 9"x13" glass baking dish.
9. Spread the fruit mixture in the baking dish and top with the crumble. Break up some of the larger crumble chunks, but keep variation in the size of the pieces.
10. Place the dish in your preheated oven and bake for 40 minutes or until the crumble is lightly toasted and the fruit is bubbling/boiling. If you use extra fruit filling, put a baking sheet under your pan to catch any overflow.
