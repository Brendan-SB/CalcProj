* 80g cheddar cheese chunks, medium or mild (1/2 cup)
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried basil
* 1 tsp crushed fennel seeds
* 1/4 cup drained and sliced pepperoncini
* 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
* 370g marinara sauce (1 1/2 cups)
* I use the NYTimes "Classic Marinara" recipe with the addition of a 6 oz. can of tomato paste to thicken. You can freeze any extra sauce.

1. Combine the ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead for several minutes, adding flour or water as needed to get a manageable hydration.
2. Lightly oil a bowl or dough bucket with space for doubling and place the dough inside. Cover and let the dough ferment rise until it has doubled.
3. My dough needed about 4 hours at about 77F with refrigerated starter that had ripened the day before. If you want a more sour dough, refrigerate the dough before it doubles and bring it up to room temperature when you're ready to use it. Depending on how long you leave it in the refrigerator and your refrigerator temperature, the dough may need additional time at room temperature to finish doubling.
4. Coat your pan with light olive oil, rubbing the oil up the sides of the pan.
5. Lay the fermented dough in the pan and gently press and stretch it outward. Let the dough rest 10-15 minutes if it is too tight, and then resume stretching it until it covers the entire base of the pan. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1-2 hours.
6. Prepare the toppings for the pizza: sauce, chopped cheeses, extra herbs, cherry tomatoes, pepperoncini, pepperoni--the possibilities are endless.
7. Begin preheating your oven to 500F (450F if your pans are nonstick) and make sure there is a shelf at the lowest position in the oven.
8. For a Detroit-style pizza, layer the toppings in this order: cheese, sauce, pepperoni OR pepperoni, cheese, sauce, which is also classic Detroit-style if you're not trying to achieve the pepperoni "cups." Make sure you take the cheese all the way to the edge of the dough.
9. For a Sicilian pizza, layer in the more conventional order: sauce, cheese, pepperoni (the order of the herbs etc is at your discretion).
10. When the oven has preheated for at least 15 minutes, place the pan on lowest rack. Lower the oven temperature to 450F, and bake for 15-20 minutes. If the sides haven't browned, continue baking for a few more minutes.
11. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for just a couple of minutes in the pan, then pry the edges away from the pan and transfer the pizza to a cutting board to finish cooling.
12. If you let the pizza cool completely in the pan, it is more likely to stick to the pan.
