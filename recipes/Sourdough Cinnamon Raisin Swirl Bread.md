## By: Melissa Johnson

* Starter/Levain Build
* 30g
* sourdough starter
* (1-2 Tbsp)
* 60g flour (1/2 cup)
* 60g water (1/4 cup)
* Final Dough
* 350g
* bread flour
* (2 2/3 cups)
* 170g
* whole grain emmer flour
* (1 1/3 cups)
* 330g water (1 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp)
* 160g
* sourdough starter
* (1/2 cup)
* 25g brown sugar (2 Tbsp)
* 25g oil (2 Tbsp)
* 12 grams salt (2 teaspoons)
* 12 grams cinnamon (4 teaspoons), divided
* 120g raisins (3/4 cup)
* water for soaking the raisins

1. Mix the starter, flour, and water in a jar. Mark the level with a rubber band and let ripen overnight. Use cold water and/or a higher feeding ratio in summertime so the levain doesn't finish all the food before morning.
2. Measure out the raisins and soak them in water while the dough rises.
3. Mix the flours, water, levain, brown sugar, oil, salt, and 1 tsp of the cinnamon in a medium bowl. Cover and let rest 30 minutes.
4. Do one round of stretching and folding, or another form of
5. gluten development
6. .
7. Let the dough rise at room temperature until it has just about doubled in size. This can take anywhere from 4 to 10 hours depending on your starter strength and room/dough temperature. My dough needed 6.5 hours in a cool kitchen.
8. Drain the raisins, lightly flour your work surface, and grease your loaf pan.
9. Remove the dough from the bowl, and stretch and pat it out into a rectangle approx. 7" x 12". Sprinkle the remaining 3 tsp of cinnamon on the dough, and then add the drained raisins in a layer on top of the cinnamon.
10. From a shorter edge, roll the dough into a tube and place it in your pan, seam-side down.
11. Cover and proof the dough for 2-4 hours. You can also retard the dough overnight or longer, but make sure it has risen in the pan some at room temperature before refrigerating it. The dough is ready to bake when it has doubled or its highest part crests about a half-inch over the lip of a 9" x 5" x 2.75" pan.
12. Preheat your oven to 375Â°F for about 15 minutes with your oven rack in the second-from-the-bottom position.
13. Brush the dough with water and load it into the oven.
14. Bake for about 60 minutes or until the interior of the loaf is over 190F. Cover with foil if the top starts to brown too much.
15. When the bread has finished baking, brush the top with oil or butter to keep it soft, and let it cool on a rack on one side to discourage settling of the crumb.
16. You can store this bread in a plastic bag, beeswax wrap, or linen bag.
