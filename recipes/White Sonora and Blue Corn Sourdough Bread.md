# White Sonora and Blue Corn Sourdough Bread
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 150g blue corn flour from varieties such as
* heirloom blue bolita corn
* ,
* heirloom blue mushito corn
* , or
* heirloom blue cÃ³nico corn
* (1 1/4 cups flour)
* 180g boiling water (3/4 cup +/- 1 Tbsp)
* 150g
* whole grain white sonora flour
* (1 cup + 3 Tbsp)
* 200g
* bread flour
* (1 1/2 cups)
* 240g water (1 cup)
* 100g ripe
* sourdough starter
* (1/3 cup)
* 12g salt (2 tsp)

1. If using whole corn kernels, mill twice, coarse and then fine.
2. Add boiling water to the fresh corn flour, mix thoroughly, cover and let rest about 30 minutes until it has cooled to less than 115F.
3. Mill the white sonora wheat and combine it with the bread flour, ripe sourdough starter, water, and salt. Cover and let this relatively dry dough autolyse while the corn porridge cools.
4. Add the corn porridge to the dough and mix thoroughly. The dough will now be sticky and delicate.
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl or bucket, cover, and let it rest for 30 minutes. Perform two rounds of stretching and folding on the dough, separated by 30 minutes.
6. Let the dough expand until it has increased in size by 50-75%. This was 6-7 hours for my dough (see photos below), which started out at a temperature of 80F from the warm corn, but quickly dropped to a room temperature in the high 60s.
7. Generously flour your work space and gently dump the dough out onto it. Add more flour to the top of the dough and pat it down. Flip the dough and pat it a little more into a rectangle shape. Form a batard, boule, or oblong loaf--see these

9. on a different dough--or the video below using this dough.
10. Place the dough into a floured proofing basket seam side up, cover, and let rise at room temperature for 30-60 minutes and then refrigerate the dough overnight (8-16 hours). You can also leave the dough at room temperature for longer (1-2 hours) and then bake it without the refrigeration stage.
11. Preheat your oven and baking vessel at 500F for 30 minutes.
12. Flip the dough out of the proofing basket and onto a sheet of parchment paper - or - directly the base of your hot baking vessel. Score, cover, and return the vessel to the oven.
13. If your baking vessel is a ceramic cloche, bake at:
14. 500Â°F for 20 minutes, lid on
15. 450Â°F for 10 minutes, lid on
16. 450Â°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off
17. If your baking vessel is cast iron, bake at:
18. 500Â°F for 15 minutes lid on and then place a baking sheet under the cast iron on the same shelf
19. 450Â°F for 15 minutes, lid on
20. 450Â°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off
21. When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 205F and it should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the loaf.
