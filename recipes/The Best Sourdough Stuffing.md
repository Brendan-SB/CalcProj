# The Best Sourdough Stuffing
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 1 cup unsalted butter (227 grams / 16 Tbsp)
* You can use half butter and half olive oil if you prefer.
* 2 large onions, diced
* 3-4 celery stalks, diced
* 8-10 mushrooms, chopped (227 grams / 8 oz)
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2-1 tsp salt
* 1/2-1 tsp pepper
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh sage
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh tarragon or parsley
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary
* 12-14 cups of cubed sourdough bread, stale or toasted (about 1Â½ loaves' worth)
* 3 cups vegetable, chicken, or turkey stock, divided
* 2-3 large eggs
* Additional fresh herbs for sprinkling
* Optional 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts or roasted chestnuts
* 1-2 cups water as needed.

1. Chop the onions, celery, mushrooms, garlic, optional walnuts or chestnuts, and herbs.
2. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, celery, mushrooms, and garlic. Saute and add salt and pepper to taste (the amount you use will depend on your preference and your stock e.g. homemade unsalted or not).
3. When the vegetables have softened, add the herbs and optional nuts, and saute for another minute or so, then add 1 cup of the stock.
4. In a medium bowl (with a pour spout if possible), beat the eggs, then add the remaining 2 cups of stock.
5. Place your cubed sourdough bread in a large mixing bowl. (You could put the bread directly in the baking pan, but stirring may be difficult.)
6. Pour the saute mixture over the cubed bread and mix. Then pour on the stock-egg mixture and fold everything until it's thoroughly combined.
7. Preheat your oven to 350Â°F and lightly oil or butter a 9x13 baking dish.
8. Transfer the mixture to your baking dish and spread evenly, cover and let sit for about 20 minutes for the bread to absorb the liquids.
9. After the rest, if the top bread cubes seem dry and there is no loose liquid underneath, sprinkle on 1-2 cups of water, stir everything again inside the pan, and then put the pan in the oven.
10. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until the internal temperature is at least 160Â°F. Cover with foil if the stuffing begins to brown too much.
11. After removing from the oven, sprinkle with additional fresh herbs if you want.
