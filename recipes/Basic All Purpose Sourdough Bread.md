1. Preheat your oven and baking vessel at 500F for 30 minutes.
2. Flip the dough out of the proofing basket and onto a sheet of parchment paper or the base of your hot baking vessel, score, cover, and return the vessel to the oven.
3. If your baking vessel is a ceramic cloche, bake at:
4. 500Â°F for 20 minutes, lid on
5. 450Â°F for 5 minutes, lid on
6. 450Â°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off
7. If your baking vessel is cast iron, bake at:
8. 500Â°F for 15 minutes lid on and then place a baking sheet under the cast iron on the same shelf
9. 450Â°F for 10 minutes, lid on
10. 450Â°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off
11. When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 205F and it should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the loaf.
12. Preheat your oven to 375F for about 15 minutes.
13. Brush the top of the dough with water and place it in the oven on the middle shelf.
14. Bake for 50-60 minutes, turning the pan halfway if the bread is browning unevenly. To firm up the bottom and sides of the loaf, take it out of the loaf pan for the last 5-10 minutes.
15. When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 200F.
16. Brush the still-warm crust with butter or oil to keep it soft.
17. Ideally, these loaves should cool for about 2 hours before slicing but I completely understand if you want to dive right into your steaming bread.
