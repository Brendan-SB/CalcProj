# Sourdough Glass Bread (Pan de Cristal)
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 400g
* bread flour
* (3 cups)
* 360g water (1 1/2 cups)
* 120g ripe
* sourdough starter
* (1/3-1/2 cup)
* 14g olive oil (heaping 1 Tbsp)
* 11g salt (2 tsp)
* Baker's Percentage by Ingredient
* 100% bread flour
* 91% water
* 3% olive oil
* 2.4% salt

1. Mix the flour and water together in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 1-2 hours.
2. Add the sourdough starter, salt, and oil to the dough. Fold the dough over itself and press and stretch the dough to work in these ingredients. Pause if the dough starts to tear.
3. Give the dough a few minutes of Rubaud mixing (video above) to strengthen and fully mix it. When the dough is smooth and uniform, cover and let it rest 30 minutes.
4. Do four rounds of gluten development such as coil folding, with 30-minute rests in between. During the first round of folding, I transferred my dough to a straight-walled container to track the rise. Stretching and folding or coil folding work nicely on this dough. There is a video link after this recipe if you want to see gluten development techniques on an even wetter dough.
5. Let the dough rise until it has expanded by 70-80%. For a warm dough (low 80s), this was about 5 hours after mixing in the sourdough starter. At cooler temps, this may take longer.
6. If you'd like to retard the dough i.e. refrigerate it overnight before shaping, do this at about 60% dough expansion, and let the dough warm up again in the morning for about an hour before shaping.
7. Prep a piece of parchment paper that is about the size of your baking stone or steel (an upside-down baking sheet can be used if you don't have a stone or steel, but beware of temp limits on non-stick sheets).
8. Heavily flour your work surface and then gently scrape the dough out onto it.
9. Use a bench knife to shove some of the flour under the oozing dough as you stretch the dough into a rectangle that's about 1 inch think. With your hands, lift and maneuver the dough to determine that none of it is stuck to your work surface. If it is, add more flour to your bench knife and work it underneath the dough.
10. Heavily flour the top of your dough and then cut it into two long narrow strips.
11. Sprinkle flour on the two cut surfaces and ensure they are not sticking to your work surface.
12. With a bench knife and a dough scraper (spatula might work too), scoop up both ends of a dough and transfer it to the sheet of parchment paper. The dough will scrunch up but as you lay it down, you can stretch it out again like an accordion. Repeat with the other dough.
13. Flour the tops of the doughs again and cover with a tea towel.
14. Let proof for about 1 hour or longer if your dough is cool. My dough was in the low 80s.
15. Set up your oven with a baking stone or steel on the second-to-lowest shelf and a cast iron pan (for steam) on the highest possible shelf, likely the second from the top.
16. Preheat this oven setup for about 45 minutes at 500F.
17. When the final proof is complete, brush off any excess flour on the doughs, and slide the parchment paper onto a peel or baking sheet with open sides like this
18. one
19. or upside-down baking sheet.
20. Boil 1 cup of water and set it near your oven.
21. Load the doughs onto your baking stone. Wearing oven mitts to prevent steam burns, pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan and close the oven door.
22. Bake for 10 minutes at 500F.
23. Lower the oven temperature to 410F and bake for 20 minutes more.
24. If you want a darker crust, feel free to bake longer.
25. Turn off the oven, crack open the oven door, and leave the bread inside for another 10 minutes. This helps the crust get more crunchy.
