## By: Melissa Johnson

* Shortcrust Pastry
* 100 grams unsalted butter (7 Tbsp)
* 80 grams sugar (6.5 Tbsp)
* 20 grams honey (1 Tbsp)
* 40 grams milk (2.5 Tbsp)
* 1 egg
* zest of orange and lemon to taste (1-2 tsp)
* pinch of salt
* 250 grams
* whole grain white sonora flour
* or fresh-milled
* white sonora wheat berries
* (2 cups flour)
* Powdered sugar for dusting on the pastiera when it has cooled.
* 330g Grano Cotto (Cooked Wheat)
* 65 grams
* white sonora wheat berries
* (heaping 1/3 cup uncooked dry berries)
* 1 liter water, more as needed (~1 qt)
* Wheat Cream
* 330 grams grano cotto from above (this is what remains after two hours of simmering the 65g wheat berries) (~2 1/2 cups of watery wheat)
* 80 grams milk (1/3 cup)
* 28 grams unsalted butter (2 Tbsp)
* 2-3 pieces of orange and lemon peel, thinly sliced
* pinch of salt
* Ricotta Citrus Filling
* 200 grams ricotta, full fat, sheep's milk if possible, pre-drained if watery (3/4 cup)
* 100 grams sugar (1/2 cup)
* 2 eggs + 1 egg yolk
* 20 grams honey (1 Tbsp)
* 20 grams milk (~1 1/2 Tbsp)
* orange blossom water to taste (15 grams / 1 Tbsp)
* zest of orange and lemon to taste (1-2 tsp)
* 65 grams citron or candied orange peel
* all of the wheat cream from above

1. Place the weighed wheat berries in a pan with plenty of water, cover, and soak overnight at room temperature. I like to make at least twice the amount needed, so I have extra breakfast porridge.
2. Mix the ricotta and sugar together, cover, and refrigerate overnight. (If the ricotta is runny, drain it first in cheesecloth, weigh it, and then mix it with the sugar.)
3. Make the short crust pastry. You can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or bowl with a stiff spatula. First cream the butter and sugar, then add the rest of the ingredients except the flour, finally add the flour. Bring the dough together, adding a little flour if it is very sticky. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate overnight.
4. Drain and add fresh water to the pan of wheat berries. You can start with 1 quart water and add more as needed. Bring up to a light boil and then set to simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Check periodically to make sure the simmer is light and the water hasn't evaporated off. When most of the wheat berries have popped open, the grano cotto is done.
5. Add the ingredients from the wheat cream list to the pan of grano cotto and simmer while stirring until the mixture is pasty. Remove the peels if desired and use a fork or potato masher to crush the berries. Add the candied peels/citron to the wheat cream and set aside to cool. For a very smooth filling, immersion blend the entire mixture.
6. Bring the ricotta-sugar and shortcrust pastry dough out of the refrigerator.
7. Whisk together all the ingredients under the ricotta citrus filling ingredient list, adding the ricotta-sugar last.
8. Finally, mix the cooled wheat cream into to the ricotta citrus filling. You now have a complete pastiera filling.
9. Preheat your oven to 360F with a shelf at the second-to-lowest position.
10. Lightly grease a 9-inch nonstick cake pan.
11. Cut your shortcut pastry dough in two pieces, approximately 2/3 for the pastiera base and 1/3 for the lattice/gelosies.
12. Flour your workspace and roll out the pastiera base. Use your pan to estimate the dough circle size, making sure you have enough to wrap the dough up the sides of the pan.
13. Carefully wrap the dough around your rolling pin and transfer it to the pan. Use your fingers to press it into the pan and repair any tears, and a knife to cut off excess crust.
14. Dock the crust base with a fork to prevent it from puffing upward while baking. This is not particularly needed for a whole wheat crust, but doesn't hurt.
15. Roll a rectangle with the second piece of dough, again using plenty of flour, and cut into seven strips.
16. Fill the pastiera base with the filling and gently tap the pan on the counter to remove trapped air.
17. Place the first four strips of the top crust on the pastiera. Don't lay the first strip dead center, or you'll have trouble spacing the other three.
18. Lay the last three strips of crust at an angle to make diamond shapes.
19. Trim the excess strips around the edge of the pan and press the strips into the base crust.
20. Extra dough can be baked as cookies; or rolled into a tube, wrapped, and frozen to bake as cookies on another occasion.
21. Bake for 50-60 minutes. About 15 minutes into the bake, wrap the edges of the pastiera with a silicone or foil pie shield.
22. Let the pastiera cool completely before you attempt to pop it out of the pan. I do this by loosening the edges, then covering it with a clean tea towel, followed by my palm, and then flipping the pastiera into my palm, removing the pan and flipping again as I gently lay it on a flat plate.
23. Pastiera can be kept at room temperature to set and fully develop its flavors.
24. On day two, you can store leftovers in the refrigerator and heat by the slice for 20-30 seconds in the microwave just to soften the texture and reawaken the aromas.
