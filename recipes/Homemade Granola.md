# Homemade Granola
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 6 cups rolled/flaked
* oats
* or other grains (600g) (I used 500g flaked oats and 100g flaked
* sprouted rye berries
* )
* Â½ cup light olive oil, canola oil, or avocado oil (110g)
* Â½ cup maple syrup or honey (170g)
* pinch of salt
* nuts, in small pieces (I use about 190g or 1 1/2 cup pecans, walnuts, or cashews)
* seeds, such as chia, flax, sunflower, pumpkin, hemp (I use about 35g or 1/4 cup flax seeds, coarsely ground)
* coconut shreds/flakes, unsweetened if possible (I use about 100g or 1 cup)
* dried fruit, such as raisins, currants, cranberries, apricots, dates, figs (I usually skip this or use about 120g or scant 1 cup)

1. Preheat your oven to 350F.
2. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the the flaked or rolled oats and sprouted rye, oil, sweetener, and salt. Honey can be briefly microwaved to make it more mixable.
3. Spread the mixture on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, a silicone mat, or lightly sprayed with oil. The layer should be about 1/2 inch thick.
4. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and add the nuts, flaxmeal, and coconut on top of the half-baked granola.
5. Return the sheet to the oven and bake 10 minutes more until everything is lightly toasted.
6. Remove from the oven and donât stir the granola unless you prefer a loose granola. Add the dried fruit on top if desired.
7. Let the granola cool for at least 30 minutes before breaking it into chunks to store in a jar, tupperware, or bag.
