# Fugazzeta (Stuffed Pizza)
## By: Melissa Johnson

* Dough
* 270 grams
* tipo 00 strong flour
* or
* bread flour
* (2 cups)
* 90 grams
* khorasan whole grain flour
* or
* khorasan high extraction flour
* (3/4 cup)
* 180 grams water (3/4 cup)
* 60 grams milk (1/4 cup)
* 14 grams olive oil (1 Tbsp)
* 10 grams
* sourdough starter
* (1-2 tsp)
* 10 grams sugar (2 tsp)
* 6 grams salt (1 tsp)
* Filling
* 14 ounces cheese (10-12 oz mozzarella and 2-4 oz provolone, parmesan, pecorino romano)
* optional 2 tsp nigella seeds
* optional 16 ounces frozen spinach (1 bag), defrosted and aggressively drained
* optional 1/2 tsp salt for if you use the spinach and don't use much or any of the saltier cheeses (e.g. provolone, parmesan, pecorino romano)
* Topping and Pan Prep
* 1 medium onion, sliced thin and soaked for about 1 hour in saltwater (1 tsp salt, 3 cups water)
* 3 Tbsp olive oil to coat the pan
* 2 Tbsp olive oil to coat the sliced onions
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* optional 1 tsp red pepper flakes

1. Mix the dough ingredients in a bowl, adding the water slowly if you change the flour types. Aim for an almost hand-kneadable dryness. Cover and let it rest about 20 minutes; it will become even more pliable and less sticky.
2. Do one round of stretching and folding of the dough. This is mostly to ensure the ingredients are evenly distributed. Cover and let it rise until it has expanded by 25-75%. If you'd like to use the dough immediately, let it rise to doubling or 100%. Otherwise refrigerate it overnight to several days.
3. Pull the dough from the refrigerator 1-4 hours before you would like to bake, depending on how expanded it is in the container.
4. Slice the onion (I like half rings) and place the slices in a bowl with saltwater to soak for at least an hour.
5. Defrost the spinach and drain it, and further squeeze out as much water as possible.
6. Slice the cheeses you plan to use and measure out your seeds, herbs, hot pepper flakes etc.
7. Preheat your oven to 425F, with a shelf in the middle position.
8. Divide the fermented dough in two pieces, about 2/3 for the base and 1/3 for the top.
9. Roll the two pieces into balls, cover, and let them rest about 20 minutes.
10. Drain the onions, pat them dry, and toss them with olive oil. If you want the onions a little more caramelized than what you see in my photos, give them a brief saute in a pan as well. I didn't do this for either of my fugazzetas, but will try it on my next one.
11. Using a rolling pin, roll both dough balls into rounds, one big enough to go up the sides of the pan, and the smaller circle to just reach across the pan.
12. Oil the bottom of your pan.
13. Transfer the larger dough round to the pan. You can roll it around your pin, and then unroll it onto the pan.
14. Fill first with 2/3 the cheese and the nigella seeds, then all the spinach and optional salt, followed by the rest of the cheese.
15. Brush water on the perimeter of the base dough where it will bind to the top dough.
16. Cover the filling with the smaller dough round and pinch the two doughs together.
17. Poke holes in the top dough with a fork to let air escape.
18. Top with the onion slices and load into the oven.
19. Bake for 25 minutes at 425F, then add a baking sheet directly under the pan.
20. Switch your oven to broil, still 425F, and continue baking for 10 minutes more.
21. If your oven only broils at 500F, move the pan to the lowest shelf possible and keep an eye on the onions.
22. Check on the top of the dough by moving some of the onion slices to the side. The dough won't necessarily look dry, because of the oil, but it should be golden and a little puffy. If the dough looks raw, continue broiling for about five minutes more with the onions on the periphery.
23. After pulling the fugazzeta from the oven, sprinkle on the oregano and optional red pepper flakes.
24. For a dramatic presentation (gooey cheese stretching from each slice), slide the fugazzeta onto a cutting board and serve piping hot. Otherwise let it cool about 10 minutes before cutting.
