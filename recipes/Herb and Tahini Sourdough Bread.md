# Herb and Tahini Sourdough Bread
## By: Melissa Johnson

* Dough
* 350g
* bread flour
* (2 2/3 cups)
* 150g
* whole grain sprouted hard red spring wheat flour
* (1 cup + 2 1/2 Tbsp)
* 400g water (1 2/3 cups)
* 80g
* sourdough starter
* (1/4 cup)
* 10g salt (2 tsp)
* Additions
* 1 Tbsp tahini (16g)
* 1/2 tsp crushed dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp crushed dried mint
* 1/8-1/4 tsp cracked black pepper
* zest of 1 small lemon

1. Mix the flours and water until incorporated. Cover and set aside 30-90 minutes.
2. Measure your additions and set them aside unless you're doing all-in mixing.
3. Sprinkle the salt on your dough, fold the dough over itself, and add the starter to the top of the dough.
4. Work the salt and starter into the dough with both hands by gently pressing, stretching and squeezing. Pause if the dough starts to tear. When the dough is smooth and uniform, cover and let rest 30 minutes.
5. Do four rounds of gluten development with 30-minute rests in between. I recommend stretching and folding for the first round, lamination with additions for the second round, and coil folding for the last two rounds. Videos of these techniques can be found

8. When putting the additions into the dough, you can fold and press them in, or dab them around the dough when it is stretched into a large rectangle during lamination. During the final two coil folds, the additions will spread more evenly through the dough.
9. The dough should begin to feel bubbly and crackly by the final coil fold.
10. When the dough has increased in size by 60-70%, it's ready to shape. My dough fermented about 5 hours at warm temps (low 80s) on a
11. Raisenne
12. dough heating pad. Depending on your starter strength and dough temperature, the first rise may be shorter or longer.
13. Scrape your dough out of the bowl onto a lightly floured work space.
14. Gently stretch it into a small rectangle and shape it into a batard, boule, or oblong loaf depending on your proofing basket shape.
15. Flour your basket and place the dough inside seam-side up.
16. Numerous proofing strategies are valid. For this loaf, I proofed at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then in the refrigerator for 14 hours. I baked the dough straight from the refrigerator without warming it up first. You can also proof the dough entirely at room temperature; 1-2 hours should be sufficient. The dough should expand 1-2 cm up the sides of the basket.
17. Preheat your oven and baking vessel to 500F for at least 30 minutes.
18. Flip the dough out of the proofing basket and onto a sheet of parchment paper or onto the base of your hot baking vessel. Score the dough, then cover and return the vessel to the oven.
19. If your baking vessel is a ceramic cloche, bake at:
20. 500Â°F for 20 minutes, lid on
21. 450Â°F for 5 minutes, lid on
22. 450Â°F for 10 minutes, lid off
23. If your baking vessel is cast iron, bake at:
24. 500Â°F for 15 minutes, lid on
25. 450Â°F for 10 minutes, lid on
26. 450Â°F for 10 minutes, lid off
27. At the 15-minute mark, place a baking sheet directly under the cast iron on the same shelf. This will prevent the base of the bread from burning.
28. When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 205F and it should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the loaf.
