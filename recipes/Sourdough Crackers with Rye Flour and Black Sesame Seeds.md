## By: Melissa Johnson

* 300 grams mixed flour
* sourdough starter
* (1 1/2 cups)
* 100 grams
* whole grain rye flour
* (3/4 cup)
* 50 grams
* high extraction all purpose flour
* (1/3 cup)
* 55 grams olive oil (1/4 cup)
* 3 grams salt (1/2 tsp)
* For topping the crackers: Additional 3 grams coarse salt (1/2 tsp) and 9 grams black sesame seeds (1 Tbsp)
* Total Ingredients
* (The sourdough starter pulls from the flour and water below. If you follow the recipe above, half the flour and all of the water are in the 300g sourdough starter.)
* 300 grams flour
* 150 grams water
* 55 grams olive oil
* 6 grams salt, divided
* 9 grams sesame seeds
* Baker's Percentages
* 100% flour
* 50% water
* 18% oil or butter
* 2% salt
* 3% sesame seeds

1. Preheat your oven to 450Â°F.
2. Combine the ingredients in a bowl, minus the toppings, and mix together. Knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth.
3. If you want the seeds to be well-trapped in the dough, add them during this initial mixing rather than later.
4. Roll out the dough to be less than 1/4-inch thick. Do this on a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat that fits a half-sheet pan. To get a uniform rectangle, trim the edges and place the pieces inside the dough and re-roll.
5. Brush or spritz with additional oil. Sprinkle on the seeds and additional salt, and roll again a few times to press in the toppings.
6. Using a pizza cutter or bench knife, cut grooves into the dough, creating a grid with the cracker size of your choice.
7. I made a 9x6 grid for 54 crackers.
8. Dock the dough with a fork to prevent big bubbles during baking.
9. Bake for 12-15 minutes, turning the tray once about 8 minutes in. Remove when the dough at the outer edges begins to brown.
10. Let cool for a few minutes and then separate the crackers on the cut lines.
