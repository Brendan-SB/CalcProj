1. For the spelt and all purpose levains, mix the ingredients, let ferment,Â and use the levain young (ripe but not peaked or deflating). For the rye levain, mix the ingredients and ferment the levain for 8-10 hours at 84Â°F.
2. The extra 10g levain can be used however you choose.
3. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the flours, water (minus any being reserved for bassinage), levain, and salt.
4. Cover and let sit for about 20 minutes, then stretch and fold until smooth. Do this again at the 40-minute mark.
5. About 1 hour after the initial mixing, add the reserved water (this technique is called bassinage). Dimple the dough and stretch and fold it around the dough gently for about 5 minutes until the water is completely incorporated.
6. Continue intermittent stretching and folding for 3 more hours. If you're making the variation with cheese, fold it in about 1 hour into this period (2 hours after the initial mixing).
7. Let the dough rise for a final hour (until about five hours since the initial dough mixing).
8. De-gas the dough and refrigerate it overnight.
9. When you want to bake, preheat your oven to 450Â°F for 20-30 minutes with a baking stone, baking steel, or upside-down baking sheet inside.
10. Dump out your dough onto wet parchment paper that you've measured to fit your baking surface.
11. Wet your hands and the top of the dough. Then using the side of your hand, divide the dough in four long pieces or "souls." Do not try to lift them from the wet parchment paper.
12. Sprinkle with caraway seeds and coarse salt, and then spray water all over the top of the souls.
13. Bake for 20-25 minutesÂ at 450Â°F.
14. Let cool for a bit and enjoy.
