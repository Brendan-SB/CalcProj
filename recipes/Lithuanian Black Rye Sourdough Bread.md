1. Mix the levain ingredients in a container with space for tripling, cover, and let ferment 8-12 hours. Aim for the long end of that range if your kitchen is cold e.g. low 60s.
2. Toast your sprouted rye flour in a pan on the stove for a few minutes, stirring regularly, until it reaches about 176Â°F. Avoid overtoasting the flour as that could introduce bitterness to the flavor. Transfer it to a bowl and add the water that's been heated to 170Â°F. Cover and let the scald sit 8-12 hours while the levain is maturing. I stored the scald in a Thermos but this isn't necessary.
3. In a bowl with room for tripling, mix together the levain, scald, and 150g rye flour. Cover and let sit overnight (8-12 hours).
4. Combine the warm water (105Â°F), honey, sugar, and salt. Stir thoroughly until dissolved. In a bowl, mix together the this liquid, the opara, and flours. A stand mixer,

7. Prepare a sheet of parchment paper or a well-floured peel.
8. Using damp hands, shape the rye dough into a tube that is about 10" x 4". Lay it on the parchment and further smooth the surface with damp fingers.
9. Cover and let the dough proof for 2-3 hours until it has expanded and has a more bumpy looking surface and a few small holes from air popping through. I used an inverted bowl as a cover to avoid plastic wrap or a cloth sticking to the dough.
10. Preheat your oven and baking stone or steel (inverted baking sheet is okay too) to 350Â°F for at least 20 minutes.
11. Prepare the glaze in a pan on the stove by whisking the corn or potato starch into the water (cold) and setting it to simmer until it has thickened. Set it aside to apply partway through the bake.
12. With wet fingertips, smooth the surface of the dough and then load it into the oven.
13. Immediately turn up the oven temperature to 445Â°F.
14. Bake at:
15. 445Â°F for 15 minutes
16. 390Â°F for 25 minutes
17. Remove the bread from the oven, apply the glaze to the surface of the bread with a pastry brush, then return the bread to the oven and continue baking at:
18. 390Â°F for 5-10 minutes
19. When the bread is finished baking, the internal temperature should be about 208Â°F. This is higher than The Rye Baker's 198Â°F but I believe it works for the moisture content.
20. Let the bread rest for 24 hours before slicing. Store in a bag, bread box, or under an inverted bowl.
