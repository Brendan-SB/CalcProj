## By: Melissa Johnson

* Pie Crust
* 1 cup
* high extraction all purpose flour
* (135 grams)
* 1 Tbsp sugar (12 grams)
* 1/2 tsp salt (3 grams)
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, chilled, cubed (114 grams / 8 Tbsp)
* 1/3 cup
* sourdough starter
* (80 grams)
* 1-4 Tbsp ice water (15-60 grams)
* Pumpkin Pie Filling
* 2 eggs + 1 egg yolk beaten
* 1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/8 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 cups fresh-cooked pumpkin OR one 15-oz can of pureed pumpkin
* 1 1/2 cups heavy cream OR 1 12-oz can evaporated milk

1. In a bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, and salt.
2. Add the chunks of butter and sourdough starter in pieces. Use your thumbs or a
3. dough blending tool
4. to smash the butter and starter into the dry ingredients. You should stop when the butter chunks are about the size of almonds.
5. You can also mix everything in a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or a food processor with the metal blade.
6. Add the ice water one tablespoon at a time only until you can bring the dough together.
7. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to three days.
8. Preheat your oven to 375F.
9. Flour your countertop, roll the dough into a circle that's about 12" diameter. Using a bench knife, pry the dough off your counter, gently fold it in half, and place it on your pie dish.
10. Crimp the edges of the crust, flouring your fingertips if needed.
11. Gently cover the entire crust with aluminum foil or parchment paper, and fill with weights or beans.
12. Bake for 10 minutes.
13. Beat the eggs and egg yolk together with the sugars, salt, and spices; then add the pumpkin puree and milk.
14. When the pie crust is done parbaking, put it on a baking sheet so you can maneuver the pie into the oven easily.
15. Pour in most of the pumpkin filling. (You will have leftover for a pudding/custard. Grease a small dish and bake it in a water bath until the internal temperature is about 175F. See photos below.)
16. Place a baking shield or aluminum foil shield around the crust and bake the pie on the sheet for 50-55 minutes at 375F.
17. To prevent cracking of the pie surface due to abrupt temperature change, turn off the oven and open the door. Leave the pie inside for about 15 minutes before removing it.
18. Let the pie cool for another 4 hours before serving.
