# Sesame Durum Sourdough Rolls
## By: Melissa Johnson

* 300g fresh milled
* durum wheat berries
* or
* whole grain durum flour
* (2 1/3 cups)
* 130g
* bread flour
* (1 cup)
* 350g water (1 1/2 cups)
* 80g
* sourdough starter
* (1/4 cup) OR 1g
* instant dry yeast
* 1/4 tsp
* 22g
* barley malt syrup
* or honey (1 Tbsp)
* 14g olive oil (1 Tbsp)
* 8g salt (1 1/2 tsp)
* approximately 1/4 cup sesame seeds to coat the dough

1. Mix the dough ingredients together in a large bowl and cover.
2. After a 15-minute rest, stretch and fold the dough to smooth out the dough and check on hydration. If the dough is gloppy-wet or stiff-dry, add a little more flour or water. You can transfer the dough to a straight-walled container at this point if you want.
3. Cover and let the dough bulk ferment until it has almost doubled in size. At warm temps (high 70s) my dough needed about 5 hours to double. In colder temperatures or with weaker starter, the dough will need more time.
4. Flour your work surface and scrape the dough out of your bowl or bucket.
5. Press the dough flat and divide it into 10 pieces (about 90g each).
6. Roll the pieces into balls and let them rest 1-2 minutes.
7. Put sesame seeds in a small bowl and measure out a piece of parchment paper that fits your baking vessel.
8. Scoop up a dough ball with a bench knife and press the damp underside of the ball into the sesame seeds while re-forming the dough into tight ball with a pinching motion at the top (see photo gallery). Repeat for all the dough balls and arrange them on the parchment paper so that they don't exceed the space of your baking vessel.
9. Cover and let the dough rise again for 1-2 hours at room temperature. The dough can also be refrigerated overnight for the final proof, just make sure to cover it well.
10. Preheat your oven and baking vessel to 500F for at least 30 minutes.
11. Remove the vessel from the oven and set it on a dish towel. Using a
12. peel
13. or
14. flat-sided cookie sheet
15. , slide the parchment onto the vessel base. Cover and return the vessel to the oven.
16. Bake at:
17. 500Â°F for 10 minutes, lid on
18. 450Â°F for 10-15 minutes, lid off
19. Feel free to serve piping hot with melted butter or let them cool and then store them in the baking vessel.
