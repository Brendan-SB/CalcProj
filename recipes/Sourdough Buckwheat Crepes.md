## By: Melissa Johnson

* buckwheat
* flour (1 cup)
* 100 grams

* (1/3 cup)

1. Combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix throroughly. Depending on the flour in your sourdough starter, your batter may need more or less milk. See this

3. for an ideal batter consistency.
4. If you want more complex flavors, at this point, you can cover the batter and let it ferment for a few hours at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator. You can also use it immediately.
5. Heat up a fry pan (non-stick is easiest) with a small amount of butter or oil. A medium burner setting usually works. When the butter is melted but not yet browned, ladle in about 1/2-1/3 cup of batter. Immediately tilt the pan around to spread the batter in a larger circle.
6. Once the the crepe has bubbles popping through, flip it and cook the second side. Total cooking time is usually just a couple of minutes.
7. Serve with whatever filling or topping you want: whipped cream, fruit, dulce de leche, nutella, lemon juice and sugar, jam or even savory fillings like spinach and cheese.
8. You can make these ahead and freeze them (well wrapped) or refrigerate for 1-2 days. To retain moisture and pliability when reheating, place a crepe on a covered plate and microwave for 20-30 seconds. A bowl or a second plate works well as a cover.
